In progress:

callbacks for libpd hooks
There are is a print callback and 5 atom event callbacks defined in libpd and
a further 7 midi-related callbacks. We should impelment all of these
as EventEmitters.
use
grep -r hook .
to find them in the libpd headers.

TODO:

get passing JS arrays as audio buffers working

Future:

spawn process to isolate libpd. 
The design of libpd is such that
it can only have one global instance per process. This presents an
odd interface to JS. Ideally we'd like to return an encapsulated
environment that points to a single instance of the pd env.
In order to do this we need to spawn as a separate proc though.

MacOS porting

The code is building under 10.8 using xcode commandline tools (gcc)
Segfault when opening file, caused by something in V8 args not
libpd it seems.
